		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

			<p>I am originally from The Bronx, NY.  I now reside in New Jersey where I live with my family.  What I love most is traveling and Photography.  I love to travel to different locations around the world and document it.  I’ve met amazing local people from different parts of the world which is truly an amazing experience.  Traveling as a great advantage of how the world truly operates. Personal experience for me is the best way to view what’s around you.
